/**
 * Exercise – Refactoring a classic data class into a record.
 *
 * <p>This exercise builds on Chapter 4’s discussion of data carriers and
 * immutability. The provided {@code Employee} class represents a typical
 * mutable
 * JavaBean-style data object with fields for {@code name}, {@code age},
 * {@code salary}, and
 * {@code department}. Your task is to refactor it into a modern {@code record}.
 * Then add a <em>compact canonical constructor</em> that validates that both
 * {@code age} and {@code salary} are non-negative values.
 * Finally Implement a new method {@code isYoungEmployee()} that returns
 * {@code true} for employees aged 25 or younger.
